<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Me in 10 seconds</h3>
<p>
I live in Cochrane, AB with a lovely wife, a beautiful daughter, and a devishly, handsome son. I make a living as an automation technician. Outside of family and friends, I spend the majority of time on my hobbies.

<p>
In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
<p>
You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
Just write inside an HTML file directly! 
So much simpler.
<p>
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:
<img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
<p>
That's it!
