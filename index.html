                Hello, My name is Gavin. This is my personal website. This site is intended to serve as a finger print of my life, a place to practice coding, 
                and somewhere I can try to articulate my thoughts into coherent blogs.
                It is currently under construction as I learn how to code and write. You are welcome to close your browser and never return. Or feel free to peruse for a bit.

                <a class="default-link" href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTJ</a> and my

                Robert Pirsig's point of view</a>, a majority of my thinking is classical. But, I sometimes dip my toes in romantic thought.
