											<h1>Hi, I’m Gavin &#128075<br />

											<p>Welcome to my site!</p>
										</header>
										<p>This site is intended to serve as a finger print of my life, a place to practice coding, 
											and somewhere I can try to articulate my thoughts into coherent blogs.
											It is currently under construction as I learn how to code and write. You are welcome to close your browser and never return. Or feel free to peruse for a bit.

											<h2>Me in &lt;5 seconds</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I live in Cochrane, AB. I work as an automation technician. My life is very busy with family, work, and hobbies.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h2>Me in &lt;5 minutes</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I grew up in Guelph, Ontario and moved to Calgary, Alberta in my early twenties. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I'm a Journeyman Electrician. I currently work in the automation field.
										</p>
										<p>
											Married my high school sweet heart and we have two beautiful children.
										</p>
										<p>
											I love running. Rain or shine. Trail or treadmill. I do it everyday. My <a class="default-link" href="https://www.runeveryday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run streak</a> is at: <span id="days_since"></span> days.</li>
											<script>
												// Calculate days since run streak start - May 4 2024
												var initialDate = new Date(2024, 4, 4); // Note that the month is zero based
												var now = Date.now();
												var difference = now - initialDate;
												var millisecondsPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
												var daysSince = Math.floor(difference / millisecondsPerDay);
												
												// Write result to HTML
												document.getElementById('days_since').innerHTML = daysSince;
											</script>
										</p>
										<p>
											I'm a hunter. I hunt every fall to provide for my family.
										</p>
										<p>
											I love hockey. I started playing when I was 27 and have been addicted ever since.
										</p>
										<p>
											I like to read and I have an eclectic taste in books.
										</p>
										<p>
											Member of Toastmasters and very interested in the art of public speaking.
										</p>
										<p>
											Hobbyist musician. I very much enjoy guitar playing when I have the time.
										</p>
										<p>
											Tinkerer. I like to build and repair things around the house.
										</p>
										<p>
											Wannabe coder.
										</p>
										<h2>Personality</h2>
										<p>
											<a class="default-link" href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTJ</a> and my 
											<a class="default-link" href="pub/persoanlity-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personality test</a> is quite accurate.
										</p>
										<h2>Philosophy</h2>
										<p>
											I'm a baptised catholic, but not a practitioner. I do appreciate the catholic values though.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have read books on <a class="default-link" href="https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stoicism</a>
											and it is something I think about often.
										</p>
										<p>
											From <a class="default-link" href="https://medium.com/@fakepixels/a-classical-romantic-aa05ff5c60fe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20classical%20understanding%20sees%20the,much%20of%20interest%20in%20it." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
											Robert Pirsig's point of view</a>, a majority of my thinking is classical. But, I sometimes dip my toes in romantic thought.
										</p>
										<p>
											A practitioner of <a class="default-link" 
											href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/01/17/the-practice-of-kaizen-will-help-you-improve-1-per-day-and-lead-to-amazing-long-term-success/#:~:text=I'd%20like%20to%20introduce,%2C%20ultimately%2C%20makes%20you%20succeed." 
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kaizen</a>. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I believe in doing difficult things, especially as I <a href="https://iwasweak.com/death?n=Gavin&bd=07-05-1986&e=82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age.</a> It's good for the soul. 
										</p>
										<p>
											After reading <a class="default-link" href="https://www.diewithzerobook.com/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Die With Zero</a>, I put a higher priority on trips & adventures with family and friends. It's probably one of the best things I have ever decided to do.
										</p>
										<p>
											I believe relationships are the cornerstone of happiness and a meaningful life.
										</p>
										<p>
											I hate complaining, especially in myself. "Wining is the antithesis to expeditionary behavior." ~Chris Hadfield
										</p>
										<p>
											Maintenance is something that is severely under-rated and under-practiced. It's vitally important in everything from vehicles, finance, relationships, health, etc. I pay a lot of attention to maintenance and place it a high priority on it.
