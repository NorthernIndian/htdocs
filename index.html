<h2>About</h2>
<p class="updated">Updated 2024-04-10</p>
<p>This site is intended to serve as a finger print of my life. It will document who I am, how I think, and what I do.</p>
<div>Here's what I am doing <div class="tooltip"><a href="pages/now.html" class="now">NOW.</a><span class="tooltiptext">Hat tip to <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek Sivers.</a></span></div></div>

<h3>Me in 5 seconds</h3>
<p>I live in Cochrane, AB. I work as an automation technician. I enjoy spending time on my hobbies and with family & friends.</p>

<h3>Me in 5 minutes</h3>
<h4>A short history</h4>
<p>I grew up in Guelph, Ontario and whimsically moved to Calgary, Alberta in my early twenties. I fell into an electrical apprenticeship and transitioned to the world of automation 
after becoming a journeyman electrician. I have been working in the oilfield for the past decade which has been an interesting experience. I married my high school sweet heart and 
we have two beautiful children.</p>

<h4>Personality</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTJ</a> and my 
  <a href="pub/persoanlity-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personality test</a> is quite accurate.</p>
 
 <h4>Philosophy</h4>
 <p>I'm a baptised catholic who does not practice the religion.</p> 
 <p>Stoicism is fundamental to my life.</p>
 <p>From <a href="https://medium.com/@fakepixels/a-classical-romantic-aa05ff5c60fe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20classical%20understanding%20sees%20the,much%20of%20interest%20in%20it." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pirsig's point of view</a>, 
  a majority of my thinking is classical. But, I sometimes dip my toes in romantic thought.</p>
