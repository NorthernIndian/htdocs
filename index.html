<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Me in 5 seconds</h3>
<p>
I live in Cochrane, AB with my family. I work as an automation technician. I am introverted and have an overly curious mind.

In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:
<img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
<p>
That's it!
