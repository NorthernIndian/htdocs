<div>Here's what I am doing <div class="tooltip"><a href="" class="now">NOW.</a><span class="tooltiptext">Hat tip to <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek Sivers.</a></span></div></div>

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<li>Some of the most common advice on happiness is to maintain good relationships. From my experience, most of the misery I have endured is from bad relationships.
    So, I have made it a top priority to nurture the good relationships in my life and actively work on making them stronger.  
</li>
<li>Started <div class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/how-and-why-to-hold-a-weekly-marriage-meeting/" class="now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage meetings</a><span class="tooltiptext">Hat tip to 
    <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett McKay.</a></span></div> in January of 2024. It was awkward at first, but we
    have embraced it and it has been good.</li>
<li>After reading <a href="https://www.diewithzerobook.com/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Die With Zero</a>, I have put a high priority on vacation and quality time with family and friends.

    <li>Whitefish again with the family for the long weekend.</li>
    <li>Triatholon race with my daughter.</li>
    <li>Camping with the family in July.</li>
    <li>Ontario with the family.</li>
