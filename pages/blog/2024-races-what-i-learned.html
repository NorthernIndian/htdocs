  <h2>Race Season is Over. This is what I learned. (2024)</h2>

  <p>I just wrapped up the 2024 race season, and boy, it was a good one.</p>

  <p>The season included the Whitefish Half Marathon, Footstock, Millaville Halfer, Powderface Halfer, and Lewiston Ultra's Moose 29k.</p>

  <p>I started training on February 12 with one of Strava's 12-week McMillan Plans. I had a fresh pair of Brook Ghost 15s and a Vivo Activ 4 watch.</p>
  <P>I had low expectations going into these races, because I performed poorly over the past several years. But this year, things started to click near the end of my training 
    cycle and I performed above my expectations.</P>

  <p>I set a new PR at the Whitefish Halfer and beat my previous best by 6 minutes. It was shocking and I found myself in a state of disbelief for about a week. I then placed 6th
    at the Footstock 10k and set a personal best for my 10k while being slightly hungover. Two weeks later, I beat my Whitefish PR by 2 minutes when I ran the Millaville Halfer.
    A couple weeks later I ran Powderface, my first trail race, and I finished 6th overall, 4th in the men's, and 1st in my category. Lastly, I ran the Moose 29k.
