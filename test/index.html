                Hello, My name is Gavin Medeiros. This is my personal website and blog. This site is intended to serve as a finger print of my life, a place to practice coding, 
                and somewhere I can try to articulate my thoughts into coherent blogs.
                It is currently under construction as I learn how to code and write. You are welcome to close your browser and never return. Or feel free to peruse for a bit.
