### Training
Prior to the race I had a traning block followed by the whitefish marathon, footstock, and Millaville. I also did a lot of running at Cochrane ranch with my hiking poles and trail 
shoes. There was a day where I ran a half marathon at the ranch. I felt ok going into the race but I had no idea what to expect because it was my first trail race. Living in Cochrane
I thought I would be ok.

### Pre-race
I ate a big breakfast as I normally do on race day. Eggs, toast, oatmeal, banana, and coffee. Luckily had a shit. And I left early because the parking lot at Paddy flats is small.
I arrived a bit too early, but I'm glad I did becausae the parking lot filled up fast. I sat in my truck for a while people watching. Lots of pretty ladies. Went to the outhouse
and it was rancid. Watched the marathoners take off. I limbered up. Downed a gel and got ready for the start. Houda McDonald was a good MC. He was charasmatic and funny. I made 
note of a lady who put up her hand when he asked if there were any fast people in the group. 

### Race
The race started off relatively flat. The terrain was so much fun for the first few km. I was like a kid. I soon found myself behind the lady who said she was fast (Sue). I decided
to pace her and it was tough. She was very fast going uphill but slow on the downhill sections. We eventually caught to a guy names MAtt. We were chatting for a bit and he almost
took the wrong trail. I had to yell him back. But that's when I passed him and flew down the hill. I got excited when the a volunteer said you guys are fourth and fift. It 
was hard to believe. I felt powerful at the halfway point. I refilled my water at the aid station. Heading back towards the finish line, there were a lot of hills, and my legs
started to fail. I just couldn't move up the hills fast enough.it was brutal. Sue passed me on the hills and there was no way I was catching up. After I got past the hills I 
made some good headway on the downhill sections. I was about 1 km from the finish line when a lady passed me from out of nowhere. I couldn't believe it. I talked to her later and 
she does most of her training in zone 2. She was cute. During the race I consumed two gels, LMT, and water. 

### Post-race
I stood around for a bit because I wasn't sure if I cracked the top 3 in the mens category. Turns out I was 4th. After that was announced, I drove home. 

I would love to do this race again, but it was expenseive and it wasn't a fun place for my family so I will need evaluate my options. The course was great though, I really enjoyed it.

Things to note. 6th overall. 4th in the mens category. 1st in my age gender category.
