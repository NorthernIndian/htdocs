### Training
Leading up to this race, I had ran the Whitefish half marathon, footstock, Millaville half marathon, and the powder face marathon.I did preety good, by my standards, in all of those races. 
I set a PB in whitefish. I set a PB in the 10k at footstock. Then beat my half marathon pb by two minutes in Millaville. And at powderface, where I wasn't expecting much, I finished 6th overall.
 4th in the men's category and 1st in my category which is m30-39.

I felt confident and in great shape, but there was a two month break between Powderface and Moose Mountain. And in that two months there was a lot of beer, burgers, and hot dogs - it was summer. I
still ran everyday, but I wasn't in peak condition, especially for a mountain run. 

### Pre-race
The race package pickup was a brewery. While picking up my package, I decided to taste test the beer which led to me buying some beer. Later that night I drank those beers with my neighbor and found
myself going to bed a little tipsy. I was awoken in the middle of the night by my daughter and wife freaking out because there was an insane storm rolling through town. Lightning, thunder, wind. I
woke up the next morning feeling very tired and a little hung over. I ate 3 eggs, 2 toast, oatmeal, and a banana. I had 2 coffees and started to sipping on electrilytes. 

When I got to the start line, I felt good. I didn't have any nerves. I was just hoping for a good race and I reminded myself to take it easy.

### Race
The race started at 08:30am. There were roughly 200 people at the start. Almost immeadately I found myself not following the plan. I was going a bit too hard. I was watching my heart rate and I was high into zone 3. I was hoping to be in zone
2 for the first hour. When we got to the base of the mountain, I found myself in the middle of a group that I thought was way too fast for me, but I felt this pressure to stay with the group. There 
5 of in this group and we took turns passing each other as we ran up the mountain. When they walked, I walked. When they ran, I ran. As I got to the peak of the mountain, I huricane force wind hit
me hard and it took the breath right out of me. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. It felt like I had just jumped into an icy lake. My nose was leaking pretty bad at this point, but I had a moustache,
so I let it run. At the turn around point I was feeling good. I gave one of the volunteers a high five and start pushing again. My plan was to go hard down the mountain, and I did. I ran 2-3 fast
kilometers and it was sketchy as hell. One wrong step and I definitely would have been injured. When I got a flat section, I opened my gel but it was nearly frozen. So I had to take my time 
consuming it. After my gel, I passed the aid station without stopping. It was at this point that my stomach started turning. I felt like I was going to shit and it was on a downhill section os I 
didn't have a chance to push hard. Eventually the pooping sensation went away, but it was replaced by a puking sensation. I then hit the wall at the 25km mark. My mind was saying GO GO, but my body
wouldn't obey. I was in 10th or 11th at this point, but several people passed me. And I eventually crossed the finish line alone and very thirsty. 

### Post-race
I did not feel well after finishing the race. I drank two glasses of water and then stumbled to my truck. I felt like I was going to vomit and I started feeling very cold. My heart rate was still
through the roof and it wasn't coming down. I tried eating but it was a battle. It took an hour to eat a sandwich. After a shower, I started feeling better, but I had to get ready for a weekend 
of camping.

Would I run Moose Mountain again? 
Yes. It's a beautiful well maintained trail and it's close to home. Thinking I might do a longer distance next year. 

Things I learned:
-Mountain races require more calories than normal races. I must consume a lot calories in race. 200 calories an hour. 
-I am capable of running these longer mountain races and I am capable of finishing at a higher rank. 
-More hill training is required.
