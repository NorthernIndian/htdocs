										<ul>
											<li><strong>Plan:</strong> A mix of the Strava McMillian and Chatgpt from May 12, 2025 to June 14, 2025.</li>
											<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Novablast 3, New Balance Rebel v4, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 </li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Huma Gels, Electrolyte Pills, & LMT</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Milage:</strong> 229.09 km</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Elevation:</strong> 2,150 m</li>
											<li><strong>VO2 Max:</strong> 53 ml/kg/min</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I came across an interesting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1jyxzxc/i_used_chatgpt_to_turn_my_350_marathon_pb_into_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on reddit where someone used ChatGPT to improve their marathon time by over 40 minutes!</p>
										<p>Having just finished a Garmin Coach training block, I wanted to try something new, so I paid for a premium subscription of ChatGPT and used the Strava-McMillian plan as a template for structuring my weeks.</p>
										<p>After every workout, I uploaded the file to ChatGPT and asked for feedback. It was like having a personal coach at my finger tips.</p>

										<h3 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Home.</li>
											<li><strong>Race Package:</strong> Just a shirt, but it's a nice shirt.</li>
											<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Homemade Burger and fries.</li>
											<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Great.</li>
											<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> LMT, coffees, two eggs, bagel with peanut butter, and a banana.</li>
											<li><strong>Travel to the Start Line:</strong> 1.5 hour drive.</li>
											<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Slightly Negative Splits via Garmin Pace Pro.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The day before the race was laid back with lots of hydrating. Not much to report.</p>
										
										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="race">Race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 09:30 am. The race was delayed because there were two trains passing through town.</li>
											<li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Saucony Endorphin Speed 4.</li>
											<li><strong>Watch:</strong> Garmin Forerunner 255s.</li>
											<li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Ceile hat, Hawaiian shirt, Nike trail shorts, Oakley Frogskin sunglasses.</li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> (3) Huma gels with an electrolyte pill taped to each one.</li>
											<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> (1) cups of water at each aid station.</li>
											<li><strong>Aid Stations:</strong> I used every aid station!</li>
											<li><strong>Potty Breaks:</strong> None.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I woke up early and took my time getting ready. It was low stress and easy going.</p>
										<p>I took my first gel at 8:45am, 15 minutes before the race. Minutes later they announced that the race was delayed because of the trains passing through.</p>
										<p>They started the 10k and half marathon race at the same time which I did not particularly like because I had to dodge a lot of people for the first kilometer. There were grandmas, kids, and what looked like an entire extended family at the front. Felt more like a Canada Day parade than a race start.</p>
										<p>Once I got past the chaos at the start, things started to space out. I noticed that I was roughly 5 seconds behind pace on every kilometer, especially that first kilometer - it put me 30 seconds behind- but I expected that. Pushing for 1:33 in Banff was ambitious, but I figured why not shoot my shot.</p>
										<p>I felt strong for most of the race, especially between 11 to 18. I passed a lot of people and nobody passed me which is unlike my previous races.</p>
										<p>The last two kilometers were probably the toughest. First off, there were so many 10k "runners" (they were walking) clogging up the trail that I had to constantly dodge them. Second, I was hurting on that final stretch and I was just trying to give a final push.</p>
										<p>I crossed the finish line and forgot to stop my watch, so there is a difference between the official time and my strava time.</p>
										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Finish Time:</strong> 01:34:51</li>
											<li><strong>Average Pace:</strong> 04:31/km</li>
											<li><strong>Overall Placement:</strong> 44 of 1772</li>
											<li><strong>Category Placement:</strong> 5 of 98</li>
											<li><strong>Recovery Meal:</strong> Protien shake, banana, brisket sandwich, fries, beer.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>It was a stretch to push for 1:33, especially for the terrain of this course, but I wanted to try, and I was happy with the effort.</p>
										<p>This was by far my best half marathon to date. I paced smart, finished strong, and felt confident. With <a href="https://www.canmorehalfmarathon.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canmore</a> up next, I’ll be balancing fun with fatigue during my 50K peak block—but if Banff is any indication, good things are ahead.</p>
										<p>On to the next.</p>
