<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>
This was my first serious half marathon where I put in a lot of work. I followed a basic 12-week strava training plan which included 4-5 runs a week.
I was averaging 50-60KM per week. All of my runs were based on pace because I was unaware of heart rate training at the time.</p>
<p>
I bought a hydration vest during this training cycle and used it on my long runs. It was fantastic compared to the hydration belt and I decided to use it during the race. 
</p>
<p>
I have a sensitive stomach and struggled with supplementation. GU makes me feel sick and Gatorade also makes me uneasy. I settled on Huma 
gels and LMT hydration. There were zero side effects when I tested these supplements. 
</p>
<p>
I trained exclusively in Brooks Ghost 15s, Nike Flex 7", and OC running hat. My hydration vest was a Solomon Active Skin 8 and I wore Oakley Holbrooks.  
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I was able to see a massuse once a month. This kept the shin splints at bay.   
</p> 
<h3 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h3>
<p>We rented a condo by the ski hill, so it was a 15 minute drive to downtown. I ate some eggs, oatmeal, and a banana in the morning. I had two coffees. Luckily I shat. </p>
<p>We left the condo 30 minutes early, but half way to the town I realized I had forgotten my bib. We had to turn around and drive back. I got to the start line with 5-10 minutes until the start. I 
consumed a gel and put myself at the middle of the pack. </p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a large race and all of the distances were starting at the same time. </p>
<p>I decided to wear my hydration vest because I wanted to hydrate on my own terms. </p>
<h3 id="race">Race</h3>
<p>I decided to take it easy for the first bit. I was running fast kms, but I was feeling very good. The course was beautiful so that distracted me for a bit. I paced this lady
who I later learned was doing the marathon. She was going very fast for a full marathon and I eventually passed her around the 13k marker. It felt good to make the pass and it 
gave me energy. It was shortly after that I slipped in my headphones and started my curated playlist. The people along the course motivated me as well, don&#39;t know why. The course
had mile markers and I did not know how long a half marathon was in miles. So when I was 12 miles, I thought there was still a more to go, but I had studied the course and new that
after the big hill going into downtown, there was only a km left. I sprinted down the hill and passed several people. The last straightway was a blur, I was running at such a strong
pace that it was hard to believe. I tool my headphones out for the last 300 meters so that I could hear the crowd. With the finish line in sight, I sprinted hard and I passed a guy
that was not expecting it. I heard my family in the crowd and it was great. Beat my PB and felt great. </p>
<p>During this race, one of my flasks had water and the other had LMT. I consumed a gel before the race and then i consumed another 2-3 gels, but I can&#39;t remember now. </p>
<p>During the race I felt great, although there was a bit of a mental struggle around the 16k mark.</p>
<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
<p>I was almost in disbelief that I set a new PB. It felt so good. </p>
<p>One thing I wasn&#39;t expecting was how sore my quads were.</p>
<p>Ate a massive american burger for dinner and felt much better. </p>
<p>I loved this race. I like that it was on the May long weekend. I like that it wasn&#39;t big. And I liked the course. It was easy to access and there wasn&#39;t a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>I probably will run it again. Might even try the full marathon.</p>
