<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>
I was training 4-5 days a week and averaging 55KM per week. All of my runs were based on pace.
</p>
<p>
My training was based on a 12-week Strava plan. I enjoyed it because I was able to program it into a google sheet and adjust the schedule as needed.  
</p>
<p>
I bought a hydration vest during this training cycle and used it on my long runs. It was fantastic compared to the hydration belt. 
</p>
<p>
I have a sensitive stomach and have struggled with supplementation in the past, but I settled on Huma 
gels and LMT hydration. There were zero side effects when I tested these supplements in training. 
</p>
<p>
I trained exclusively in Brooks Ghost 15s, Nike Flex 7" shorts, and an OC running hat. My hydration vest was a Solomon Active Skin 8 and I wore Oakley Holbrooks.  
</p>
<p>
I used a Garmin Vivo Activ 4 watch. 
</p>
<p>
I received one massage per month leading up to the race.     
</p> 
<p>
My training block left me feeling confident before the race. 
</p>
<h3 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h3>
<P>
I woke up early. I ate eggs, oatmeal, and a banana. I had two coffees. Luckily I shat.
</P>
<p>
We left the condo 30 minutes early, but half way to the town I realized that my bib was missing. We had to turn around and drive back. I got to the start line 5 minutes before gun time. I 
consumed a gel and placed myself mid-pack. 
</p>
<p>
I made a last minute decision to wear my hydration vest because I had trained with it and was worried about switching things up. I filled one flask with water and the other with LMT.
</p>
<h3 id="race">Race</h3>
<P>
The race started at 08:30am mountain time.
</P>
<p>
The marathon, half marathon, and 10k started at the same time, so it was tough to know who you were running with.
</p>
<p>
I decided to take it easy for the first bit. The course was beautiful and I really tried to soak it in.
</p>
<p>
Gel consumed at 9:15am.
</p>
<p>
As I was running, I noticed the course was marked in miles. I had no idea what 21.1K was in miles, so I was slightly confused about what distance I had covered. I could have looked at my watch, but I 
didn't want to. 
</p>
<p>
Gel consumed at 10:00am.
</p>
<p>
As we came back to familiar territory, I realized there was only 1-2 km remaining. I put the jets on and started to sprint. I passed 4 people in the last stretch including a guy in the last 100m. He definitely
wasn't expecting it.
</p>
<p>
I crossed the finish line in 1 hour and 38 minutes. I beat my previous PR by 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>During this race, one of my flasks had water and the other had LMT. I consumed a gel before the race and then i consumed another 2-3 gels, but I can&#39;t remember now. </p>
<p>During the race I felt great, although there was a bit of a mental struggle around the 16k mark.</p>
<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
<p>I was almost in disbelief that I set a new PB. It felt so good. </p>
<p>One thing I wasn&#39;t expecting was how sore my quads were.</p>
<p>Ate a massive american burger for dinner and felt much better. </p>
<p>I loved this race. I like that it was on the May long weekend. I like that it wasn&#39;t big. And I liked the course. It was easy to access and there wasn&#39;t a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>I probably will run it again. Might even try the full marathon.</p>
