										<ul>
											<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Garmin Coach from December 3, 2024 to May 3, 2025.</li>
											<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Novablast 3, New Balance Rebel v4, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4  </li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Huma Gels, Electrolyte Pills, & LMT</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Milage:</strong> 1313.24 km</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Elevation:</strong> 12,541 m</li>
											<li><strong>VO2 Max:</strong> 58 ml/kg/min</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I picked up a new Garmin watch on Black Friday, and with it came access to Garmin Coach. I decided to give it a shot for this marathon training block. It took a bit of getting used to—I couldn’t reschedule workouts, which was a bit of a pain at first—but after a couple of weeks, the training algorithm and my schedule started to sync up nicely. One of the standout features for me was how it integrated HRV and sleep data into its programming. It felt like the workouts were truly tailored to how I was feeling each day, which was a nice touch. Plus, seeing my weekly workout schedule auto-sync to my Google Calendar was super convenient. That said, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Garmin Coach had a habit of changing workouts at the last minute—literally as I was tying my shoes sometimes. Not exactly ideal. And for long runs? Pretty vague. It would just say, “Run 2 hours at Zone 2,” without much context or specific goals. Overall, it’s a solid tool and definitely handy, but I’m thinking of trying something different for the next race.</p>
										<p>This training cycle was the first time I experimented with multiple shoes in rotation, and honestly, it made a big difference.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Novablasts for the treadmill: Solid overall, but way too loud. Every step felt like I was slapping the ground.</li>
											<li>Rebel v4s for easy runs: Absolute favorite. Ridiculously comfortable—like running on clouds.</li>
											<li>Endorphin Speed 4s for speed work and long runs: Took some time to figure out the lacing to give my toes enough room, but once I dialed that in, they were great…just not so much for easy days.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>One last thing I tried this training cycle was taping electrolytes to my gels. Simple, but supremely effective. No more fumbling around in pockets or digging through my vest mid-run. Everything I needed was right there, ready to go. I honestly don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner. Game changer.</p>

										<h3 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel.</li>
											<li><strong>Race Package:</strong> Biggest running expo I've been to. I like the race shirt that was included.</li>
											<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Old Spahgetti Factory - Chicken Fettuccine with a glass of red wine.</li>
											<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> I was anxious about the race, so I didn't sleep the greatest.</li>
											<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> LMT, coffees, bagel with peanut butter, and a banana. I also had some welsh gummies 30 minutes before the race.</li>
											<li><strong>Travel to the Start Line:</strong> Sky Train and a 15 minute walk - about 45 minutes in total.</li>
											<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Negative Splits via Garmin Pace Pro.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I booked a hotel right in the heart of downtown Vancouver, just steps away from the finish line. It wasn’t cheap, but I wanted to get a real taste of what these big-city marathons are all about. Plus, I wanted the experience to be convenient and fun for my family. And if I’m being honest, I really just wanted a hot shower before the mad dash to the airport.</p>
										<p>The day before the race, I probably spent a bit too much time on my feet. We wandered around Granville Island, soaking up the atmosphere, and even biked around Stanley Park. Not exactly textbook pre-race resting, but it was worth it.</p>
										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="race">Race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 08:30 am.</li>
											<li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Saucony Endorphin Speed 4.</li>
											<li><strong>Watch:</strong> Garmin Forerunner 255s.</li>
											<li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Ceile hat, Hawaiian shirt, Nike trail shorts, Oakley Frogskin sunglasses.</li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> (6) Huma gels with an electrolyte pill taped to each one.</li>
											<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> (2) cups of water at each aid station.</li>
											<li><strong>Aid Stations:</strong> I used every aid station - the volunteers were great!</li>
											<li><strong>Potty Breaks:</strong> Zero and no tummy trouble, although I had to clench my butt cheeks twice in the final stretch.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I woke up early, had a solid breakfast, and hopped on city transit to Queen Elizabeth Park where the start line was buzzing with energy. I found myself about 200 feet from the front, tucked just behind the 3:20 pacer—right where I wanted to be. I was feeling good. Actually, I was feeling really good.</p>
										<p>For the first 20 miles, it was pure magic. I had Garmin PacePro dialed into my watch, and I was consistently about 10 seconds per kilometer faster than the target pace. I stuck to my plan: a gel every 25–30 minutes and two cups of water at every aid station, which seemed to pop up about every half hour. It felt automatic—water or gel every 15 minutes. Smooth sailing.</p>
										<p>The crowds were awesome. I didn’t expect so many people lining the streets, yelling and cheering. Apparently, my shirt was a real hit—I got chirped non-stop, and honestly, it was hilarious and motivating. I couldn’t help but smile for most of those miles.</p>
										<p>But then came Stanley Park. It was like stepping into a whole different race. The crowds disappeared, and I was left alone with my thoughts…and the pain. My quads were toast—especially my left one. It felt like a dead piece of meat, just along for the ride. At one point, I was practically limping. But I kept grinding, even though my pace had dropped off. I tried to pick it up for the last 2K, but it felt like my legs were running in wet cement.</p>
										<p>That final stretch was unreal, though. The crowds were back, the energy was wild, and I even spotted my family cheering me on. Crossing that finish line was a surreal experience.</p>
										<p>After crossing the finsih line, it was like every runner instantly turned into a zombie—limping, stumbling, not entirely sure what to do. I found my family and made a quick dash to the hotel for a much-needed shower. My lips turned blue for a bit and I got seriously cold, but after some water and a banana, I started to feel somewhat human again…except my quads. They were absolutely destroyed.</p>

										<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Finish Time:</strong> 03:27:37</li>
											<li><strong>Average Pace:</strong> 04:52/km</li>
											<li><strong>Overall Placement:</strong> 959 of 6883</li>
											<li><strong>Category Placement:</strong> 164 of 740</li>
											<li><strong>Recovery Meal:</strong> Banana, bacon burger, and onion rings.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I didn’t quite hit my goal of 3 hours and 20 minutes, but I’m okay with it. The experience itself was what made this race so damn fun and memorable.</p>
										<p>For a first marathon, it’s going to be tough to beat this experience.</p>
