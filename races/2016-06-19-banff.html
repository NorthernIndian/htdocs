										<p>This was my second race, and I went in with way too much confidence, despite nursing a sore knee. Like my first race, I barely trained. My mindset was simple: "Running is easy, no big deal." Well, this race quickly showed me how wrong I was.</p>
										<p>About halfway through, my knee pain escalated, and I found myself limping, feeling like Terry Fox on a bad day. To make matters worse, a speed walker passed me, which was a pretty harsh blow to my ego.</p>
										<p>To add to the chaos, the course was altered last minute because of bear activity, which only added to the absurdity of the day.</p>
										<p>By the end, I was convinced I’d never run again due to the state of my knee. But after the race, I decided to see a physiotherapist. My knee felt wrecked, and I was desperate for answers. The therapist did some acupuncture and gave me a few simple stretches (something I had never bothered with before). Since then, I’ve never had a knee problem again.</p>
										<p>This race taught me the hard way how important stretching is. I ended up buying a foam roller, and ever since, I’ve been rolling out my skinny little legs.</p>
										<p>P.S. - no photo and no race certificate.</p>
