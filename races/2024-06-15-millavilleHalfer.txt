### Training
I was coming off a half marathon training program and setting a PB at the whitefish halfer. I was still training, but this was more of a fun race for me. I looked at the finishing 
times for the past couple of years and thought I had a good chance of finishing high depending on who showed up. 

### Pre-race
Millaville race grounds are close to an hour drive from my house so I left early, maybe a bit too early because I was one of the first people there. They had shuttles that ran 
from the race grounds to the school in Diamond Valley. I was on the first shuttle and there probably 20 of us on the bus. We got to the school an hour before the race so we just
stood around and stretched. It was very disorganized. I noticed that they had race package pickups at the rink so I could have avoided a 2 our drive the day before. I chatted with
an older guy for a bit and found out that he was going to running the moose 29k in august too. I went outside 15 minutes prior to the race and had a gel. They had ZZ-Top cranked 
on the PA. There was some guy talking on the PA but it was hard to hear him. People were saying, we can't hear you, but he just kept going. And the race just started. lol.

### Race
I was very close to the front when it started. I was wearing my hydration vest again. I felt myself going fast, probably too fast. I passed a lot of people. The valley we ran
through was beautiful. There was a large hill that I sprinted down early in the race. But then we had another uphill that was brutal. There was a speedy old guy that stopped to
use the porta potty and I passed him. He eventually caught up and passed me again. It was nuts. It was beautiful once we hit the flat highway, I really enjoyed that stretch. But
there were two big hills on that stretch that killed my speed. I got passed by two or three people on those hills. The last bend in the road had a knight on horseback and a maiden.
It was at this point where I went full throttle and it was intense. The finish line was at the stampede grounds and I finished in 1 hour 36 minutes. 

### Post-race
My family was waiting for me at the finish line so that was very cool. I had a couple of cookies, a coffee and we walked around the market for a bit. I was surprised that I didn't 
feel all that sore. After whitefish, my quads were seized but today nothing. I was very satisfied with the new PR. We watched the kids play at the park for a bit and then we went
home.

For next year, I will not drive down the day before beause it is a waste of time. I will drive down early the morning of and get my bib. The only painful thing is carrying the swag. 
I am also hoping to get a few people to sign up for this race because it was so much fun. Justin Peterson said he would be doing it. Maybe I can convince some other guys.
