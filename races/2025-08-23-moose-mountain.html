										<ul>
											<li><strong>Plan:</strong> This race fell on week 10 of 16 for my Whitefish 50k training plan.</li>
											<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Solomon Active Skin 8, Black Diamond Distance FLZ Carbon Trekking Poles, Garmin Forerunner 255s, and a mix of shoes (Brooks Catamount, Novablast 3, New Balance Rebel v4, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4). </li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Huma Gels, Electrolyte Pills, & LMT</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Milage:</strong> 740 km</li>
											<li><strong>Total Training Elevation:</strong> 2487 m</li>
											<li><strong>VO2 Max:</strong> 53.3 ml/kg/min</li>

										</ul>
										<p>I was in week 10 of my 16-week training block for the Whitefish 50K. I had factored this race into the plan, treating it as a long run while also approaching it with an experimental mindset. My goal was to see how my body would respond to the distance while staying relaxed in Zone 2. Would I still have energy at the finish? How would I feel the next day? Would it reduce the usual pain?</p>
										<p>Whatever the outcome, I felt primed and ready for the race.</p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Home.</li>
											<li><strong>Race Package:</strong> Pickup was at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z5dppwx9nDeozBXh6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Born Brewing</a>, and they had some great swag this year: a really nice Ceile hat and a pint glass with the race logo.</li>
											<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Spaghetti.</li>
											<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Pretty good, 7-8 hours.</li>
											<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Coffee, LMT, eggs, bagel with jam, and a cliff bar.</li>
											<li><strong>Travel to the Start Line:</strong> 30 minutes.</li>
											<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> High zone 2/low zone 3 for the first 30k and then reassess.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Just like last year, I treated myself to a couple of tall boys from Born Brewing when I picked up my race package. It was just light beer, so I doubt it had any impact on my sleep or performance the next day. Dam good beer, though.</p>

											<li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 08:30 AM</li>
											<li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Brooks Catamount 3.</li>
											<li><strong>Watch:</strong> Garmin Forerunner 255s.</li>
											<li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Nike Flex 7" shorts, old Banff race t-shirt, Ciele running hat, Solomon Active Skin 8, and Oakley Frogskins.</li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Huma gels and electrolyte pills.</li>
											<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> I went through 5-6 liters of water.</li>
											<li><strong>Aid Stations:</strong> Only stopped for water.</li>
											<li><strong>Potty Breaks:</strong> Nope, but I had tummy trouble.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>It was a perfect race day—cool weather and legs that felt ready. At the start line, I ran into <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/86289587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Labine</a>, which made me laugh; we had run together at <a href="/races/2024-06-29-powderface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powderface</a> the year before, so it was nice to see a familiar face.</p>
										<p>The race kicked off at 8:30 a.m. and I kept my eyes glued to my heart rate. Anytime I crept into Zone 3, I eased off. I probably could have pushed harder, but I didn’t want to risk hitting the wall.</p>
										<p>Surprisingly, I found myself passing people while staying in Zone 2 during the first 12–15K. A few runners pulled ahead on the steeper climbs, but I kept them in sight. Near the summit of Moose Mountain, I was shocked to see Labine already descending—absolutely flying, and it impressed the hell out of me.</p>
										<p>Once I hit the descent, I stashed my poles and let gravity take over, sprinting down and overtaking runner after runner—including the ones who had passed me earlier. After Moose Packers, I didn’t see another racer for at least an hour.</p>
										<p>Around the 35K mark, the 50K leader blew by me, and soon after I started spotting runners ahead. I managed to pass one, but he reeled me back in and snagged 10th overall.</p>
										<p>It was also around then that the gels started turning my stomach. I felt waves of nausea and thought I might vomit, but I managed to hold steady.</p>
										<p>Despite that rough patch, I kept pace and finished strong. Seeing my family—and Mark S.—at the finish line made it all worth it.</p>

										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Finish Time:</strong> 04:54:44</li>
											<li><strong>Average Pace:</strong> 7:12/km</li>
											<li><strong>Overall Placement:</strong> 11th of 53</li>
											<li><strong>Category Placement:</strong> 6th of 16</li>
											<li><strong>Recovery Meal:</strong> Mucho Burrito - the biggest burrito they had.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I ended up staying in Zone 2 for about 90% of the race, which makes me think I could have pushed a little harder on the easier sections. That said, this was the first race I truly enjoyed from start to finish.</p>
										<p>Learning from both Vancouver and this race, I now realize that success requires more than just monitoring heart rate—I also need to dial in my in-race nutrition. I can’t survive on gels alone; real food is absolutely necessary for long efforts. Moving forward, I’ll start experimenting with different foods during training to find what works best for me.</p>
