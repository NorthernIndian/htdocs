										<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Plan:</strong> This was two weeks after Millarville, so I didn't follow a formal training block. I was relying on the fitness I built with my previous training blocks and races.</li>
											<li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Brooks Cascadia.</li>
											<li><strong>Watch:</strong> Garmin Vivo Activ 4.</li>
											<li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Nike Flex 7" shorts, OC running hat, Solomon Active Skin 8, trekking poles, and Oakley Holbrooks.</li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Huma Gels, Stinger Waffles, and LMT.</li>

										</ul>
										<p>I was in descent condition for this one, but I did some additional training at the Cochrane Ranch and focused on getting as much vert as I could. I practiced using my poles and eating while on the move. I also did a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11699694898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halfer</a> to simulate race conditions.</p>
										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Accomidations:</strong> Home. I was only a 35 minutes drive from the start line.</li>
											<li><strong>Race Package:</strong> I signed up to this race late, so I checked in the morning of the race. No shirt, but there was a nice hat and a moleskin running journal.</li>
											<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Can't recall.</li>
											<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Pretty good, 7-8 hours.</li>
											<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Eggs, oatmeal, and a banana.</li>
											<li><strong>Travel to the Start Line:</strong> 35 minutes.</li>
											<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Wasn't sure on pacing, so I decided to follow one of the faster looking people from the start.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I arrived at Station Flats extra early since parking was limited. It gave me the chance to watch the marathoners start their race, which was a nice bonus. I really enjoyed the atmosphere at the start — it was small, low-key, and everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there. Kevin Houda did an awesome job as MC, bringing great energy to the morning.</p>
										<hr class="major" />
										<h3 id="race">Race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 08:00 AM</li>
											<li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Brooks Cascadia.</li>
											<li><strong>Watch:</strong> Garmin Vivo Activ 4.</li>
											<li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Nike Flex 7" shorts, Whitefish race t-shirt, OC running hat, Solomon Active Skin 8, and Oakley Holbrooks.</li>
											<li><strong>Supplements:</strong> (3) Huma Gels and LMT.</li>
											<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> (2) 500ml flasks. One was filled with LMT.</li>
											<li><strong>Aid Stations:</strong> Had to stop at one of the aid stations to refill my flask. Looks like they had lots of goodies, but I didn't eat anything.</li>
											<li><strong>Potty Breaks:</strong> None and no tummy trouble.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Before the race, Kevin asked the crowd who the fast runners were, and a woman confidently raised her hand. Right then, I decided I was going to follow her.
											When the race began, I felt great — legs were fresh, spirits high. Eventually, I found myself right behind that woman, using her pace to guide me. We ended up leapfrogging each other throughout the course, but when we hit the hills near the end, she absolutely crushed them and left me in the dust.
											Somewhere along the way, I met another runner named Matt. We chatted for a few kilometers, but at one point he took a wrong turn and nearly veered off course. I had to shout him back before he went too far.
											I was feeling strong up until the final stretch — that’s when the course hit us with a brutal uphill section. I struggled to climb it, and by the time I reached the top, it felt like I hit the wall. My legs turned to lead, and even the tiniest inclines felt like mountains.
											In the last kilometer, a woman came out of nowhere and blew past me, sprinting full tilt to the finish. I did my best to follow, but ended up hobbling in a minute or two behind her.
										</p>

										<h3 id="post-race">Post-race</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Finish Time:</strong> 02:22:02</li>
											<li><strong>Average Pace:</strong> 6:18/km</li>
											<li><strong>Overall Placement:</strong> 6th of 77</li>
											<li><strong>Category Placement:</strong> 1st of 7</li>
											<li><strong>Recovery Meal:</strong> Can't recall.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I stuck around for a bit to see who made the podium. I thought there was a chance that I was 2nd or 3rd, but it turns out I was 4th in the men's category.</p>
										<P>I would love to do this race again, but it was expensive and it wasn't a fun place for my family to hang out. The course was great though and I really enjoyed it. This would be a fun one to do again with friends.</P>
										<p>It was also a great introduction to trail running.</p>
