### Training
This was my first serious half marathon where I put in a lot of work. I followed a McMillian plan religiously and visualized the race many a times.

I followed a basic training plan through strava that was 12 weeks long. I felt really good leading up to the race although, I took a weekend off to play a hockey tournament. I feel like the hockey
tournament might have thrown off my rythym a bit but it was worth it. 

### Pre-race
We rented a condo by the ski hill, so it was a 15 minute drive to downtown. I ate some eggs, oatmeal, and a banana in the morning. I had two coffees. Luckily I shat. 

We left the condo 30 minutes early, but half way to the town I realized I had forgotten my bib. We had to turn around and drive back. I got to the start line with 5-10 minutes until the start. I 
consumed a gel and put myself at the middle of the pack. 

It wasn't a large race and all of the distances were starting at the same time. 

I decided to wear my hydration vest because I wanted to hydrate on my own terms. 

### Race
I decided to take it easy for the first bit. I was running fast kms, but I was feeling very good. The course was beautiful so that distracted me for a bit. I paced this lady
who I later learned was doing the marathon. She was going very fast for a full marathong and I eventually passed her around the 13k marker. It felt good to make the pass and it 
gave me energy. It was shortly after that I slipped in my headphones and started my curated playlist. The people along the course motivated me as well, don't know why. The course
had mile markers and I did not know how long a half marathon was in miles. So when I was 12 miles, I thought there was still a more to go, but I had studied the course and new that
after the big hill going into downtown, there was only a km left. I sprinted down the hill and passed several people. The last straighaway was a blur, I was running at such a strong
pace that it was hard to believe. I tool my headphones out for the last 300 meters so that I could hear the crowd. With the finish line in sight, I sprinted hard and I passed a guy
that was not expecting it. I heard my family in the crowd and it was great. Beat my PB and felt great. 

During this race, one of my flasks had water and the other had LMT. I consumed a gel before the race and then i consumed another 2-3 gels, but I can't remember now. 

During the race I felt great, although there was a bit of a mental struggle around the 16k mark.

### Post-race
I was almost in disbelief that I set a new PB. It felt so good. 

One thing I wasn't expecting was how sore my quads were.

Ate a massive american burger for dinner and felt much better. 

I loved this race. I like that it was on the May long weekend. I like that it wasn't big. And I liked the course. It was easy to access and there wasn't a lot of traffic.

I probably will run it again. Might even try the full marathon.
