<p>A month ago, I turned 39 and entered that twilight zone of my thirties. My mom called. Some friends checked in. Grandma’s card made its annual pilgrimage through the mail. My daughter handed me a homemade card filled with scribbles and love. I went for a run, cooked steaks and potatoes, and called it a day. Uneventful—and perfect.</p>
  <p>Every year on my birthday, I like to look back and take stock. Here's what stood out in year thirty-eight.</p>

  <h2>🗭 Snapshot of the Year</h2>
  <h3>Top 3 Memories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Running my first marathon in Vancouver and keeping a one-year run streak alive</li>
    <li>Moose hunting</li>
    <li>Swimming in the ocean with my kids</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Stats at a Glance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🏃‍♂️ 2,796 km run</li>
    <li>⛰️ 42,609 m elevation gain</li>
    <li>✈️ 52 flights taken</li>
    <li>🍺 339 alcoholic drinks</li>
    <li>📚 9 books read</li>
    <li>🏋️‍♂️ 51 gym sessions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3 Things That Worked</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cutting back on alcohol → better sleep and training</li>
    <li>Embracing Garmin data → more awareness, more gains</li>
    <li>Marriage meetings → more connection, less chaos</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3 Things That Didn’t</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Gym consistency → once a week isn’t cutting it</li>
    <li>No stretching or physio routine → flirting with injury</li>
    <li>Reading took a hit → time to reprioritize</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✈️ Travel</h2>
  <p>This year was flight-heavy: Whitefish, Guelph, Kincardine, Czar, Puerto Vallarta, Vancouver, and the ever-glamorous Fort Hills. In total? 52 flights.</p>
  <p>The big takeaway: traveling for races is awesome. My wife and I plan to keep this going—maybe Quebec City, Victoria… maybe even Europe?</p>

  <h2>🏃 Health and Running</h2>
  <p>The Garmin Forerunner I picked up on Black Friday turned out to be my best health investment. It revealed what I probably didn’t want to admit: alcohol wrecks my sleep and recovery. As a result, I cut back—and it’s been a game-changer for training.</p>
  <p>I ran <strong>2,796 km</strong> with <strong>42,609 meters of elevation</strong>. That’s more than <em>double</em> last year’s mileage. I completed <strong>six races</strong>, including my first marathon, and I’m proud to say I’ve maintained a <strong>365-day run streak</strong> (and counting).</p>
  <p>This was the year I truly learned the importance of fueling—before, during, and after a run. It's not optional. It's the difference between surviving and thriving.</p>
  <p>Recovery-wise, massage and acupuncture kept me functional. Stretching and physio, however, did not. That needs to change.</p>
  <p>I hit the gym just <strong>51 times</strong> this year—less than once per week. Not ideal. My goal: bump that to twice per week. Weight training makes everything better—physically and mentally.</p>

  <h2>❤️ Relationships</h2>
  <p>My wife and I started doing monthly marriage meetings in early 2024. It’s one of the best hacks for a calmer, more connected relationship. This small ritual led to more date nights and more laughter. In the coming year, we’re aiming for twice a month.</p>
  <p>Time with my kids remains the highlight of my life. That won’t change.</p>
  <p>I also made time for friends—through hockey, hunting, camping, BBQs, and even stand-up shows. I plan to keep that momentum going. One goal for next year: <strong>find some running friends</strong>. Partly for the chats. Mostly so my wife stops worrying I’ll get eaten by a bear.</p>

  <h2>💻 Coding</h2>
  <p>There are few things I love more than coding with a coffee in hand. This year, I built my personal website, helped friends with their projects, and set up a custom email. Time is tight, but I’m committed to the long game.</p>
  <p>I don’t know if coding will become my career, but I do know this: I’m going to die trying. By next year, I hope to be much further along in my dev journey.</p>

  <h2>🗣️ Toastmasters</h2>
  <p>I gave <strong>four speeches</strong>, one short of my goal. One was awful. One was the best I’ve ever delivered. It was a real rollercoaster.</p>
  <p>Our club was on the brink, but we turned things around with new members and renewed energy. After 10 years, I can honestly say I no longer fear public speaking. That alone is worth the effort.</p>

  <h2>🍺 Alcohol</h2>
  <p>I logged <strong>339 alcoholic drinks</strong>—down nearly 80 from the year before. I’ve mostly ditched hard liquor and weekday drinking. Light beer now reigns supreme, and I reserve the strong stuff for special occasions.</p>
  <p>Garmin gets the credit here. Seeing the impact on sleep and recovery made it easy to cut back.</p>

  <h2>☕ Caffeine</h2>
  <p>I drank <strong>2–3 cups</strong> of coffee every single day. I’ve dialed in the timing to avoid messing with sleep. I’ll continue monitoring my intake, but… yeah. I don’t see this changing anytime soon.</p>

  <h2>📚 Reading: My Lowest Year Yet</h2>
  <p>Just <strong>9 books</strong> this year—the lowest since I started tracking. There are reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I stopped listening to audiobooks while running.</li>
    <li>I swapped Kindle time at work for meditation.</li>
    <li>I spent more time coding than reading.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That said, I’ve started listening to books on my runs again, and I’m setting aside time before bed for reading. Expect a rebound next year.</p>

  <h2>🎯 Goals for Year 39</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lift weights <strong>twice per week</strong></li>
    <li>More <strong>family time</strong></li>
    <li>Find <strong>running buddies</strong></li>
    <li>Keep improving as a <strong>developer</strong></li>
    <li>Reduce <strong>alcohol</strong>, monitor <strong>caffeine</strong></li>
    <li>Read <strong>more books</strong></li>
  </ul>
