                 <h2>The Night the Lights Went Out</h2>

					<p>
						Imagine you're at home. It’s a normal weeknight. You’re cooking dinner, maybe yelling at the kids, and you finally
						sit down to relax. It’s one of those evenings where everything feels routine… almost boring.
					</p>

					<p>
						Then the power goes out.
					</p>

					<p>
						You check your phone — no reception. You look outside — pitch black. Streetlights, houses, everything. You shrug and
						grab a couple extra blankets because it's winter, and houses cool down fast without a furnace.
					</p>

					<p>
						Morning comes. Still no power. You decide to drive to work. You get in your vehicle, turn on the radio — static. Every
						traffic light is out. Cars are gridlocked. Nobody knows what’s going on. You turn around and go home.
					</p>

					<p>
						A week later, there’s still no power. No communication. Your home is cold. Your pantry is empty.
					</p>

					<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>

					<h2>The Movie That Sparked It</h2>

					<p>
						A few weeks ago, my wife and I randomly put on a film called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12747748/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Leave the World Behind</em></a>. It’s not your typical apocalypse movie.
						No aliens. No zombies. No asteroids. Just one thing: the world goes dark… and never turns back on. 
					</p>

					<p>
						And for some reason, that scenario freaked me out more than any other disaster movie ever has. It made we wonder:
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>What if the power went out in January?</p>
						<p>What if trucks stopped delivering food?</p>
						<p>What if the water from the tap simply stopped flowing?</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						It was scary to think about, especially with two young kids. Sure, I can keep them warm with blankets and live off
						noodles for a couple days, but after that, there’s no plan.
					</p>

					<p>Out of curiosity, and a strange morbid fascination, I went down a rabbit hole to find the most likely “Modern Apocalypse” scenarios. </p>

					<h2>The Most Likely “Modern Apocalypse” Scenarios</h2>

					<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1. Solar Flares (Carrington Event)</a></h3>

					<p>
						The Sun regularly sends out massive bursts of energy called solar flares. More than 99% of the time, that energy
						either misses Earth or dissipates harmlessly. But occasionally, Earth is hit — creating what’s known as a
						Carrington event.
					</p>

					<p>
						The last major one hit Earth in 1859 and was powerful enough to fry telegraph systems and cause electrical fires.
					</p>

					<p>
						If a Carrington-level event hit today, experts estimate it could knock out large portions of the power grid for
						weeks, months, or even years. Scientists estimate a 10–12% chance over the next century.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2. Nuclear Conflict (High-Altitude EMP)</a></h3>

					<p>
						Nuclear conflict has been a threat since World War II, but today there’s a lesser-known risk: high-altitude EMP.
					</p>

					<p>
						A nuclear detonation high above Earth wouldn’t harm people directly, but it could disable power, communications,
						and electronics across an entire continent.
					</p>

					<p>
						Studies surveying nuclear-risk experts estimate a 1–5% chance of a major nuclear-use event in the next few decades.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/7899-great-toilet-paper-scare-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3. Pandemic</a></h3>

					<p>
						We just lived through COVID, so we don’t need to imagine this one. We saw empty shelves, supply shortages, and
						delays in essential services — even with the power still on.
					</p>

					<p>
						Studies estimate a 1–3% chance each year of another major pandemic.
					</p>

					<p>
						None of these scenarios are likely to happen tomorrow — but they’re not impossible.
					</p>

					<h2>Prepared, Not Paranoid</h2>

					<p>
						After watching that movie, something clicked. I thought:
					</p>
					
					<blockquote>
						<p>I insure my truck.</p>
						<p>I insure my house.</p>
						<p>I even buy race insurance.</p>
						<p>What insurance is there for a survival situation?!</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>The answer: none! There is no survival insurance. You are on you own when shit goes down.</p>

					<p>
						Sooo I became a prepper — not a doomsday prepper with a bunker in the backyard like you would see on the history channel — just a moderately prepared kind of prepper.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's what I put together:

                  <p>When we talk about rare, unpredictable disasters, the goal isn’t to panic, it’s to prepare.</p>

                  <p>It’s not about building a bunker. It’s not about being paranoid. It’s about being mindful of how fragile our systems really are and being prepared for the worst.</p>

                  <p>Because if the day ever comes when the lights go out and they don’t turn back on… you’ll wish you had more than noodles and blankets. </p>
